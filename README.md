# Linear-SRG


Code for plotting the SRG of an LTI transfer function.

`LTI-SRG.jl` contains julia code for computing the SRG of a transfer function and a matrix.

`LTI-SRG.m` contains MATLAB code for computing the SRG of a transfer function.

`Graham_scan.jl` contains an implementation of the Graham Scan method to compute the convex hull of a set of points.
